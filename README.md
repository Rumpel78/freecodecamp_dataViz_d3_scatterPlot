# [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) Data Visualization Certificate
##  Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

What I have used to fullfill this assignment:
* [d3-es6-boilerplate](https://github.com/Packet-Clearing-House/d3-es6-boilerplate) by Packet-Clearing House to have a simple starting-point with Browersync and ES6 in place:
 * [d3js](https://d3js.org) of course
 * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) as my build system
 * [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) with browsersync, rollup, babel and eslint
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft - my current favorite editor

Thanks to:
 * d3noob for the [simple d3js tooltip](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369)
 * [dashing3djs.com](https://www.dashingd3js.com/the-data-visualization-process) for the great tutorial
